    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>After a Muslim passes away, their deeds come to an end—except for specific acts mentioned by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Family and loved ones can still help the deceased and earn reward for themselves, through the following actions:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>1. Making Du‘a (Supplication)</h3>
        <p>The most powerful and immediate way to benefit the deceased is to sincerely pray for their forgiveness, mercy, and ease in the grave.</p>
        <blockquote>
            The Prophet ﷺ said: <strong>“When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.”</strong> (Sahih Muslim)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Example du‘a:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>“O Allah, forgive [name], have mercy on them, and admit them into Paradise.”</em></li>
            <li><em>“Rabbighfir li wa liwalidayya wa lil-mu’mineena yawma yaqum al-hisab.”</em> (Qur’an 14:41)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>2. Giving Charity (Sadaqah) on Their Behalf</h3>
        <p>You can donate to the poor, build a well, support a masjid, or fund Islamic education in their name. This is especially effective when it's ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah).</p>
        <blockquote>
            A man asked the Prophet ﷺ: “My mother died suddenly, and I think if she could speak, she would have given charity. May I give charity on her behalf?” He replied: <strong>“Yes.”</strong> (Bukhari, Muslim)
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>3. Fulfilling Missed Obligations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Paying off their debts (financial or missed fasts, Hajj, etc.) if known.</li>
            <li>Fasting missed days (optional, depending on school of thought).</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            “Whoever dies owing a fast, his guardian must fast on his behalf.” (Bukhari, Muslim)
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>4. Reciting Qur’an & Seeking Reward for Them</h3>
        <p>According to many scholars, it is allowed to recite the Qur’an and ask Allah to grant the reward to the deceased (though not a replacement for du‘a or charity).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Surah Yasin, Surah Al-Mulk, Surah Al-Fatiha are common choices.</li>
            <li>Say: “O Allah, grant the reward of this recitation to [name of deceased].”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>5. Visiting the Grave & Sending Peace</h3>
        <p>Visiting graves reminds us of death and allows us to pray for the deceased.</p>
        <blockquote>
            The Prophet ﷺ said: <strong>“Visit the graves, for they remind you of death.”</strong> (Muslim)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Say at the grave:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>“Peace be upon you, O dwellers of this place. You have preceded us, and we are following.”</em></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rules-section">
        <h3>6. Spreading the Knowledge They Left</h3>
        <p>If they wrote books, taught people, shared beneficial Islamic knowledge—continuing that legacy helps their scale of good deeds grow even after death.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Islam prohibits innovated practices such as placing food near the grave, wailing, or rituals not proven in the Sunnah. Instead, stick to what is clearly beneficial from the Qur’an and Hadith.
